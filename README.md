# Advent Of Code 2022

I'm attempting to solve puzzles from advent of code 2022.

https://adventofcode.com/2022

I use the PHP language for solving these puzzles.

## Calculating an answer

To calculate an answer, run the following command in your command line interface, from the repo root:

```sh
php index.php [dayNumber] [partNumber]
```

Or, you can just visit the `index.php` file in your browser (running on a PHP webserver.)
